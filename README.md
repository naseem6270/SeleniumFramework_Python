# SeleniumFramework_Python

Setup instructions (this assumes that you already have Python and pip installed)
If you clone this repo, you can do pip install -r requirements.txt to install both pytest and selenium at once. Otherwise, you can install them one by one. Note that you will still need to install geckodriver, since Selenium 3 does not support default Firefox:
pytest
Install pytest via pip or easy_install:
pip install -U pytest or easy_install -U pytest
After installation, you can check the installed version by running:
pytest --version
selenium webdriver
Install selenium via pip:
pip install -U selenium
geckodriver
Unix
Download tar file from geckodriver
Go to download location and extract the file:
tar -xvzf geckodriver
Make geckodriver executable:
chmod +x geckodriver
Add geckodriver executable to your PATH. The default PATH is set in the /etc/environment file. Add the location there if it is not already set, e.g.
PATH="/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:<geckodriver location>"
Alternatively, you can move the executable to the location/s specified in your PATH variable
Windows
Download and extract zip file from geckodriver
Get the executable file's location and add it to your Environment Variables. Instructions on setting the path can be found here
How to run the tests
To run all tests inside the test directory, simply run this command:
pytest
or python -m pytest
This will open multiple Firefox browsers, since each module is calling a separate Firefox instance.

To run a test module, simply do
pytest <module name>
e.g. pytest test_markers.py
To run a specific test, do
pytest <module name> <class name> <test name>
e.g. pytest test_markers.py::TestSignupPage::test_assert_empty_signup_form
It is recommended to run the tests with verbosity by invoking -v during the test run.
If there are print statements you wish to see on the console when the tests run, add -s to disable stdout capturing.
